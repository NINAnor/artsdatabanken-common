This software imports common resources from [artsdatabanken.no](https://artsdatabanken.no), storing them in a SQLite database, which is then exposed on the web using Datasette.

The rationale behind this project is to make easier for both researchers and developers to fetch information about species, their status, and NiN categories, by providing a simple interface, with filters and export capabilities, without having to figure out ways to fetch and parse data from artsdatabanken.
